I have this original account

User: bhaaonline 
Email:bhaa.online@gmail.com
youtube - https://www.youtube.com/user/bhaaonline
google+ - https://plus.google.com/111924634936207038909/posts

and this second account 

User: BHAA 
Email: info@bhaa.ie

google+ - https://plus.google.com/100447837155479206123/posts

I've setup both accounts with google plus pages, but am unsure how to transfer the ownership between the acounts via the google plus manager setup. How can i migrate all the 'bhaaonline' videos to be controlled by the 'BHAA' account?
