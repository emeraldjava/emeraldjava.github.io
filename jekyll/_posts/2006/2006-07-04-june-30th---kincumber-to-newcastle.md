Get the<br />first drops of rain as i approach swansea, decide to stop for lunch and<br />let the weather pass.<br /><br />The rain has stopped after lunch but the roads are wet and cold for the final<br />30km into newcastle. Find the YHA with no hassel.<br /><br />Vince Golding the new owner of my trek fuel 90 mountain bike is from newcastle,<br />had suggest checking out "The Brewrey". I confirmed that it this as its name suggest - have beer.<br /><br />World cup quater finals, had a feeling the germany game would go to penalties.<br />Didn't care about the other game, german will beat them in the semi either way.
