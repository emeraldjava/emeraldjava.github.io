I also replaced the chain, rear gear cogs and brake blocks. It's amazing how smooth the ride on the bike is now. The weather didn't help the view from the top.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0857.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0857.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Taken on the decent back into the city, glad i replace the brake blocks.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0865.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0865.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Once I was back in the city, i decided "forest gump" like to continue cycling, and had lunch on the beach near henley. It was tough having to sit in a pier, with warm sun and sound of waves as i ate my lunch.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0868.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0868.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />For the stat's people, the polar heart rate/speed/altitude graph of todays ride.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/MtLofty.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/MtLofty.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />The evening will be spent with luandry, blogging and figuring out a plan for what/where to do next week.
