The first of the 10km specific sessions was a 6 times 1 mile with 3 mins recovery.&nbsp;I did a 15min warmup&nbsp; <br /><br />Lap     Mile    Pace<br />1 5:25.3 3:23<br />2 5:14.0&nbsp;3:16<br />3 5:12.3 3:15<br />4 5:17.5 3:18<br />5 5:23.8 3:22<br />6 5:29.8 3:26<br /><br />10 min cool down.       <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/160477117">http://connect.garmin.com/activity/160477117</a><br /><br />Looking at the times i should have done some strides before the first one, since the 10s diff between 1 and 2 is too much. Over the 6 laps the average pass was 3.20 which indicates a 33.3x 10km time. Need to get the finger out for the next scheduled session which is 1*2Mile + 4*1Mile on thursday.<br /><br />The schedule is outlined here      http://runningtimes.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=19553
