Toured around CBD, victoria market, richmond, fitzroy and the MCG today. The plan tomorrow is to cycle down the Mornington Peninsula, use the ferry to cross the bay and spend the night in Torquay.</description></item><item><title>Wednesday 31th May</title><link>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-31-wednesday-31th-may/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-31-wednesday-31th-may/</guid><description>Moved to a hostel in St Kilda today for 2 nights, the CBD is dead at night. Spent the rest of the day touring around melbourne, its so easy having your own transport to just skip past places. Did a lap of the albert park grand prix circuit, not sure if i was on the same pace as the F1 dudes. Picture of the Melbourne skyline taken from albert park in the last afternoon.</description></item><item><title>Tuesday 30th May</title><link>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-30-tuesday-30th-may/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-30-tuesday-30th-may/</guid><description>In Hong Kong International airport for a 2 hour stopover before the final leg of the flight to melbourne, which should get me there for 19.30 this evening.
Interesting landing into melbourne, I&amp;rsquo;m looking out the window to see the city lights expecting to have a nice view for a few minutes before we touch down, but first lights i see are the airport lights. There a bit close i&amp;rsquo;m thinking, when next thing the plane slaps the runway like a tonne of bricks, or metal hitting the ground.</description></item><item><title>Monday 29th May 2006</title><link>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-29-monday-29th-may/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-29-monday-29th-may/</guid><description>Flew from London Heathrow T4 (12.20pm) to Hong Kong with Quantas today.</description></item><item><title>La Marmotte 2005</title><link>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2005/2005-08-07-la-marmotte-2005/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Aug 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2005/2005-08-07-la-marmotte-2005/</guid><description>Took me 10h 37min 50seconds, came in 3623rd place.</description></item></channel></rss>
