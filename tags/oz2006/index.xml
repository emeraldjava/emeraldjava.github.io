Joined the Nepean highway near chelsea and followed it down via Frankston, Mornington and St Marta. The bike lane on the main road was really wide and most vehicals gave me plently of room.
2006-06-02-beach Hauling the fully loaded bags on the bike finally kicked in about 40km. I was expecting the first couple of days to be tough, but not this bad this early.</description></item><item><title>Thursday 1st June 2006</title><link>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-06-01-thursday-1st-june/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-06-01-thursday-1st-june/</guid><description>Just chilled around melbourne again today, sorted an aussie mobile number [0448 997 380 ] and some replacement tubes for the bike. Toured around CBD, victoria market, richmond, fitzroy and the MCG today.
2006-06-01 The plan tomorrow is to cycle down the Mornington Peninsula, use the ferry to cross the bay and spend the night in Torquay.</description></item><item><title>Wednesday 31th May 2006</title><link>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-31-wednesday-31th-may/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-31-wednesday-31th-may/</guid><description>Moved to a hostel in St Kilda today for 2 nights, the CBD is dead at night. Spent the rest of the day touring around melbourne, its so easy having your own transport to just skip past places. Did a lap of the albert park grand prix circuit, not sure if i was on the same pace as the F1 dudes.

2006-05-30 Interesting landing into melbourne, I&amp;rsquo;m looking out the window to see the city lights expecting to have a nice view for a few minutes before we touch down, but first lights i see are the airport lights. There a bit close i&amp;rsquo;m thinking, when next thing the plane slaps the runway like a tonne of bricks, or metal hitting the ground.</description></item><item><title>Monday 29th May 2006</title><link>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-29-monday-29th-may/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-29-monday-29th-may/</guid><description>Monday 29th May 2006 Flew from London Heathrow T4 (12.20pm) to Hong Kong with Quantas today.</description></item></channel></rss>
