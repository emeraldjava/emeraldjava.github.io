Spent the rest of the day touring around melbourne, its so easy having your own transport to just skip past places. Did a lap of the albert park grand prix circuit, not sure if i was on the same pace as the F1 dudes. Picture of the Melbourne skyline taken from albert park in the last afternoon.</description></item><item><title>Tuesday 30th May</title><link>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-30-tuesday-30th-may/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-30-tuesday-30th-may/</guid><description>In Hong Kong International airport for a 2 hour stopover before the final leg of the flight to melbourne, which should get me there for 19.30 this evening.
Interesting landing into melbourne, I&amp;rsquo;m looking out the window to see the city lights expecting to have a nice view for a few minutes before we touch down, but first lights i see are the airport lights. There a bit close i&amp;rsquo;m thinking, when next thing the plane slaps the runway like a tonne of bricks, or metal hitting the ground.</description></item><item><title>Monday 29th May 2006</title><link>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-29-monday-29th-may/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://emeraldjava.github.io/post/2006/2006-05-29-monday-29th-may/</guid><description>Flew from London Heathrow T4 (12.20pm) to Hong Kong with Quantas today.</description></item></channel></rss>
