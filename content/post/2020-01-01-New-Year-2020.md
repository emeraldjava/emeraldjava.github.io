# Guitar Chord Markdown

I've been looking to transfer all my guitar songs from paper to digital, in a format which will be easy for web and mobile devices. I'd like to have the content in a markdown file, and then render the chords, version, bridge and chorus to a final display page.

## Markdown Libary

The first stop was to these libraries which handle markdown to html coversion

- https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown
- https://marked.js.org/#/README.md#README.md

Perhaps they could be extended to support the 'song-book' keywords i need.

There is this Stackoverflow question
