Just chilled around melbourne again today, sorted an aussie mobile number [0448 997 380 ] and some replacement tubes for the bike. Toured around CBD, victoria market, richmond, fitzroy and the MCG today.

The plan tomorrow is to cycle down the Mornington Peninsula, use the ferry to cross the bay and spend the night in Torquay.
