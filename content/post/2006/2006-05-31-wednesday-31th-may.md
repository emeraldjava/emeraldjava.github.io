Moved to a hostel in St Kilda today for 2 nights, the CBD is dead at night. Spent the rest of the day touring around melbourne, its so easy having your own transport to just skip past places. Did a lap of the albert park grand prix circuit, not sure if i was on the same pace as the F1 dudes. Picture of the Melbourne skyline taken from albert park in the last afternoon.

Went down to the Esplande Hotel to hear the live music they have there. The place is a old hotel, where they've converted all the major rooms into different stages for bands and dj's. Would be cool to see the place packed out, reckon it would rock. www.espy.com.au <br /><br />Had two frigging punchers today!!, I know shep is laughing as he reads this - PUNK.
