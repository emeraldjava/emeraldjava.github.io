So i thought this was an early april fools joke when i saw the two talks for this evening. A nodejs meetup dedicated to home craft beer brewing but the agenda is the agenda and i shit you not. I suspect these guys are going to put my little home brew setup to shame.

1st talk : [brewfactory.org](http://brewfactory.org/)

I had come across this project already [brewpi](http://www.brewpi.com/)

2nd talk : [Cylon.js](http://cylonjs.com)
