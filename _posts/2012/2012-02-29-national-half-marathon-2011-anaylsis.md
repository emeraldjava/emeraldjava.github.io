<br />With the Meath Half coming up this weekend I decided to look at my split from the last good half I ran last yesterday in Waterford. At the time I was in the middle of the marathon training program and&nbsp;tapered&nbsp;well for the week before the race<br /><br />Split<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Moving Time<br />1<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:13.4<br />2<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:20.5<br />3<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:16.1<br />4<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:26.3<br />5<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:23.6<br />6<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:23.1<br />7<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:29.1<br />8<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:20.9<br />9<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:24.2<br />10<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:20.3<br />11<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:22.7<br />12<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:09.2<br />13<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:20.3<br />14<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:31.5<br />15<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:13.1<br />16<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:28.5<br />17<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:14.4<br />18<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:18.1<br />19<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:17.5<br />20<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:20.3<br />21<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>3:18.7<br /><br />The time splits at the main 5km markers were<br /><br />16:40<br />33:38<br />50:14<br />66:53<br /><div><br /></div>which indicates these 5km splits time<br /><br />16:40<br />16:58<br />16:37<br />16:39<br /><br />I remember taking it out handy enough and was in a good position to push on in the second half of the race. Looking at the 5km splits now the 1st, 3rd and 4th splits are all similar enough with a diff of 3seconds between them. At the end of the race I was a bit disappointed to have come that close to the 70min barrier. Perhaps the day dreaming in the 2nd 5km section was were the time was lost. The overall time of&nbsp;1h 10m 15sec which is the current half PB.<br /><br /><div><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/111886067">http://connect.garmin.com/activity/111886067</a></div><div><br /></div><div>In terms of this weekend I'm not 100% sure about the right hamstring but I think the course and potentially the runners in the field could make this a fast course. Will see in the coming days if a new PB time will be targeted.</div>
