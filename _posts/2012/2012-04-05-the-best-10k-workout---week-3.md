We supposed to be 1*2Mile and then 4*1mile but having created the garmin workouts i discovered that only one workout can be downloaded. The downloaded workout was 6*1mile - here are the details<br /><br /><br />Split,Time,Distance,Elevation+,Elevation-,Avg Pace,Avg Moving Pace,Best Pace,Avg HR,Max HR<br />&nbsp;1,5:10.1,1.60,4,6,3:14,3:11,2:41,157,169,<br />&nbsp;2,5:10.9,1.60,9,8,3:14,3:11,2:31,161,173,<br />&nbsp;3,5:11.0,1.60,9,9,3:14,3:12,2:36,163,174,<br />&nbsp;4,5:11.5,1.60,8,8,3:15,3:14,2:28,163,173,<br />&nbsp;4,5:14.5,1.60,7,7,3:17,3:14,2:37,163,170,<br />&nbsp;6,5:19.5,1.60,8,7,3:20,3:18,2:34,161,170,<br />&nbsp;Summary,48:36.9,47:17.0,11.36,45,47,4:17,4:10,2:28,145,174<br /><br />Was&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;by the simular times of the first four, usual fifth slowdown and had idea that the sixth might have been quicker but the overall times are quicker.<br /><br /><a href="http://connect.garmin.com/activity/165003822">http://connect.garmin.com/activity/165003822</a><br /><br />These UCD tuesdays sessions might be paying some dividend. 10miler in ballyliffin this weekend. First of the 2mile sessions next week - am tempted to jump to 2*2M+2*1M.<br /><br /><br /><br />
