I've always found updating the format of my CV quite a pain, and during the most recent review of my CV is decided that an XML based approach would be the best.<br /><br />First step was to convert the details in my existing word doc cv to a XML format. I looked at <a href="http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/">xml resume</a> format but decided to use the <a href="http://www.hr-xml.org/">hr-xml</a> format in the end.<br /><br />Next step is to use a xsl transform to convert the xml into an output format. While researching the transforms I found the <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hresume">hresume mircoformat</a> which seems well supported. <a href="http://lab.madgex.com/hresume/">Madgex</a> provide a tool for converting a html format into a PDF/Word format which solved one of my problems.<br /><br />In order to ensure a level of sanity to the html layout and fonts, i decided to reuse the <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">twitter-bootstrap</a> resources.<br /><br />While working on the xml cv file and xsl transform i used my <a href="https://github.com/emeraldjava/emeraldjava">github repository</a> to track changes. The final piece of the puzzle was where to host the generated html resume file. I found that github provided this via the <a href="http://pages.github.com/">gh-pages</a> branch which allows a file to be served as raw html to a browser.<br /><br />The <a href="http://emeraldjava.github.com/emeraldjava/cv">hresume html</a> is hosted here and the madgex pdf is linked on the right hand column of this blog. Now to get the CV out to the market.
