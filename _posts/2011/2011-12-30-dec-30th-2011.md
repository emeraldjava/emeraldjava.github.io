There will be one blog from now on so i merged the content of cycleaustralia.blogspot.com adventurtures-of-a-slite-300.blogspot.com to emeraldjava.blogspot.com, it was quite easy once i found the blogspot import export tool. Added the next 7 bhaa event and story details to glfusion. Having some trouble trying to create a function on the mysql instance on the mac. And the Rover decided it didn't want to start this evening, so the plan evening run in dublin had to be cancelled.
