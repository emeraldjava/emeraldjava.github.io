Herr Kinsmann better deliver the goods now. Bit pissed off that the "man u" ronaldo had to score the winner. Alle le bleu.<br /><br />Getting out of newcastle on a sunday was good, since with three lane highways for the first 40km on the pacific highway. I reckon a monday morning would have seen me playing death cycling with large trucks. <br /><br />Hit "The Buckets Way" which is another of these aussie road that seem flat, but have never ending slight rises and large decents. For a simple 150m climb, i had to accended over 800m today.<br /><br />Yet again the navigator has under estimated the distances, we're going to have to review the staff profile.
