Stopped for lunch in the town of Beaudesert.<br /><br />The final run into Ipswich was pain with tight, endulating roads with lots of city traffic.<br /><br />Was passing this scrap yard, went this dog appears at my wheel, running along side and going mental. I unclipped one foot from the peddal in case the dog did anything and i had to stop. Seems to be going fine, near past this dogs patch, and its slowing down when the fucker makes a last effort and bits my leg - just a little scratch but still sore and some blood. Anyway the dog thinks its great now, and is on for more of this game.. I don't agree.. so the defensless leg thats been bitten, now turns into an offensive weapon. I flick the leg and get the heal to connect with the right ear area of the dogs head, he decided the game wasn't that much fun then..<br /><br />Get into Ipswich and find Adam St, where Noel and Deirdre live.
