Had to get the<br />8.30 ferry which was as choppy as the irish sea in winter. Was feeling a little<br />bit green when we arrived.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_1107.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_1107.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />A nasty 350m climb for the 5 km was tough, and not cleaning the chain after the dirty roads on monday was not the best idea. Had a strong head wind all the way, which made the going hard, and you know your up against it when you have to peddle to keep the bike going downhill.<br /><!--<br /><IMG SRC="../../../photos/Cape Jervis to Adelaide/CapeJervisAdelaide.JPG" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="400" BORDER="0" ALT=""><br />Just crashed once i got to the cannon st hostel in adelaide.<br />-->
