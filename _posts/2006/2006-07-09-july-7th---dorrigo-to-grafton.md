<TABLE BORDER="1"><TR><TD>Distance</TD><TD>Overall Total</TD></TR><TR><TD>124 km</TD><TD>1785 km</TD></TR></TABLE><br /><br />From dorrigo i can take an easy route to Coff Harbor, but being me i take more difficult route and head directly to Grafton, a descent which in fact involves more climbing. The first 20km are paved, but then we have 20km of dirt roads. Some dodgy downhill sections and slippy turns - TOO EASY. The last 10km to the main road, is a nice 700m drop on good roads, avaraged 40kmph on the drop.<br /><br />Final 75km into grafton was bit of a pain, but the next two days will be easier.
