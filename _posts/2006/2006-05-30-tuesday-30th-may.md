In Hong Kong International airport for a 2 hour stopover before the final leg of the flight to melbourne, which should get me there for 19.30 this evening.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0586.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0586.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Interesting landing into melbourne, I'm looking out the window to see the city lights expecting to have a nice view for a few minutes before we touch down, but first lights i see are the airport lights. There a bit close i'm thinking, when next thing the plane slaps the runway like a tonne of bricks, or metal hitting the ground. There a small issue of a loud bang and bits of the internal roof panel coming loose and dropping onto this dudes head, who sitting a couple of rows ahead of me. He grabs the panel and holds it while the whole plane slows. Lots bemused people and stupid jokes as we get of the plane.<br /><br />No hassel getting the bike in via aussie customs, they just check thats are is not muck on the frame.
