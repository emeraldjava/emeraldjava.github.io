Eventually find Manly beach and work my way up the coast, getting to Palm beach eventually.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_1215.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_1215.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Use the ferry to cross the channel. The late start and ferry delay, means i have to stop in Kilcumber to the night.
