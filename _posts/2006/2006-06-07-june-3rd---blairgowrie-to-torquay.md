I slept like a log, and was feeling quite good this morning. Despite a water restriction in place in the area, this guys must have used about 10 buckets of water to wash his car, i was worried that the car might start sinking into the ground.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0605.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0605.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Started early and was making good time to the passenger ferry from portsea, 4km past sorrento as the guide book stated. Arrived in portsea to find no quay, and to be told that the only ferry leaves from sorrento, stupid guide book!!  Nearly set a land speed record getting back to sorrento. Nice 40min ferry trip brought me across the entrance port philip day. The sky line for melbourne was still just about visible. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0606.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0606.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Starting in queenscliff, i followed the coast road to Pt Lonsdale (see nice photo of light house) and then onto ocean grove and barwon heads. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0620.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0620.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />The road turns in land from then on and joins the surf coast highway. The final strech of road into torquay seemed be a constant 10km rise. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0627.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0627.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
