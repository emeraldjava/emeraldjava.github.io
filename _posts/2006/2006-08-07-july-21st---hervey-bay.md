Signed up for a 3 day tour of Fraser Island, which will leave tomorrow. Fixed up a reservation for mmy bus north to airley beach, and a reservation on a sailing tour up there for Saturday week.<br /><br />The afternoon was a meeting the tour group and sorting out food and camping gear. There are 4 germans [1 mann, 3 madchen], 3 english girls, a spanish couple and me. In total there are 5 groups of 11 going from the hostel.
