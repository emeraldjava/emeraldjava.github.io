10.00am<br /><br />Left adelaide on a 24 hour train journey to sydney.<br /><br />4.00pm<br /><br />I know why the train takes 24 hours, because its only going about<br />30kmph - i reckon i'd cycle quicker. Seems every OAP in austalia is<br />afraid of flyling or else they gets a free ticket, because the average <br />age on the train has to be in the triple figures. Train stops for a<br />hour at broken hill, maybe there's a retirment village there.<br /><br />7.00pm<br /><br />Broken Hill - having been stuck on the train for 8 hours i was looking<br />forward to this stop, to strech my legs for an hour. I was back in my<br />seat after 15 minutes - absolutly NOTHING to do in this town. <br /><br />23.00pm<br /><br />Two dudes have got on from somewhere in the middle of nowhere. I now know how<br />to track, kill and a render various native and ferial animals of the austalian<br />outback. Seems shooting is the main leisure activity of the two dudes. Kangeroos, <br />foxes, emu's, wild boars, rabbits, cats and many more animals are on the nightly<br />hit list for these boys. Beers and four wheel drive vechicals are also needed.<br /><br />00.43pm<br /><br />All the beer has been drunk and the bar's closed. The track seems to have been built over every bump.
