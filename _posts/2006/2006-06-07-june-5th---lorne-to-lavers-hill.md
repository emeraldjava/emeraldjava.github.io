Had the company of some cockatoos as i was having my breakfast this morning.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0666.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0666.jpg" border="0" alt="Cockatoos" /></a><br /><br />Just remember that you need specialist training to photograph cockatoos, on the off chance that they attack. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0670.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0670.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Got going at 9 heading for apollo bay, the road on this section is cut into <br />the cliff face in places, and offers some amazing views of coast. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0672.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0672.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Stopped in apollo bay [45km] at 11, for an early lunch and rested for an hour. <br />The next section to Lavers Hill was always going to be tough. The road rises<br />through the Otway National Park, and then drops and levels out in the Aire <br />river valley. The final climb to Lavers Hill rises 500m over 10km, which seems<br />simple on paper, but for every climb of 20 meters, theres a drop of 10 meters,<br />so for a simple 500 meter climb, the actual accent needed on the bike is about<br />1000 meters!! <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0687.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0687.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />The back wheel on the bike is now feeling the pressure of the extra bag weight,<br />what started as a small buckle had grown, and now there are two broken spokes.<br />On the final climb, i had to loosen the rear brakes to allow the wheel to travel<br />more easily. Will have to get this fixed in Warrnambool, when i take a rest day<br />on Wednesday.<br /><br />Having finally made it up the climb to Lvers Hill, i then actually cycled right <br />through the village. The term blink and you'll miss it takes on a new form.
