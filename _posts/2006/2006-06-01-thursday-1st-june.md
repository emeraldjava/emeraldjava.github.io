Just chilled around melbourne again today, sorted an aussie mobile number [0448 997 380 ] and some replacement tubes for the bike. Toured around CBD, victoria market, richmond, fitzroy and the MCG today. <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0589.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0589.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />The plan tomorrow is to cycle down the Mornington Peninsula, use the ferry to cross the bay and spend the night in Torquay.
