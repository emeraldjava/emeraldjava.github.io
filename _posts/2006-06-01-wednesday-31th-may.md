Moved to a hostel in St Kilda today for 2 nights, the CBD is dead at night. Spent the rest of the day touring around melbourne, its so easy having your own transport to just skip past places. Did a lap of the albert park grand prix circuit, not sure if i was on the same pace as the F1 dudes. Picture of the Melbourne skyline taken from albert park in the last afternoon.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_0591.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_0591.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Went down to the Esplande Hotel to hear the live music they have there. The place is a old hotel, where they've converted all the major rooms into different stages for bands and dj's. Would be cool to see the place packed out, reckon it would rock. www.espy.com.au <br /><br />Had two frigging punchers today!!, I know shep is laughing as he reads this - PUNK.
