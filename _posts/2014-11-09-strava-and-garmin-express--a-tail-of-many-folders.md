 With the recent upgrade by Garmin from Garmin Connect to Garmin Express it seems there are now three seperate folder in which my training files are saved.

Untitled ▸ Users ▸ pauloconnell ▸ Library ▸ Application Support ▸ Garmin ▸ Devices ▸ 3610720948 : 24/5/2014 -> 22/6/2014
Untitled ▸ Users ▸ pauloconnell ▸ Library ▸ Application Support ▸ Garmin ▸ GarminConnect ▸ -3610720948 ▸ Upload ▸ FitnessHistory : 24/6/2014 -> 9/9/2014
Untitled ▸ Users ▸ pauloconnell ▸ Library ▸ Application Support ▸ Garmin ▸ Express ▸ RegisteredDevices ▸ 3610720948  ▸ PendingSyncUploads ▸ History : current

I also setup my <style>
.strava-badge- { display: inline-block; height: 48px; }
.strava-badge- img { visibility: hidden; height: 48px; }
.strava-badge-:hover { background-position: 0 -63px; }
.strava-badge-follow { height: 48px; width: 48px; background: url(//badges.strava.com/echelon-sprite-48.png) no-repeat 0 0; }
</style>
<a href="http://strava.com/athletes/7035778/badge" class="strava-badge- strava-badge-follow" target="_blank"><img src="//badges.strava.com/echelon-sprite-48.png" alt="Strava" /></a> account and began importing my data to it.
