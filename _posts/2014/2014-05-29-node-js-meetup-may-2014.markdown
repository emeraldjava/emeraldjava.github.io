Notes from the [www.nodejsdublin.com](http://www.nodejsdublin.com/) meeting in [https://www.engineyard.com/](Engine Yard), Barrow St, Dublin.

The topic this evening is "Building a Reverse Proxy With Node and Performing Scalability Testing On It" and is being presented by the guys from Citi bank. Seems they are hiring as well atm.

[HAPI](http://spumko.github.io/) is a server framework for node that citi use for proxing. [Aman Kohli](http://ie.linkedin.com/in/kohlia) [akohli](https://twitter.com/akohli) explains the move away from SOAP,XML and the need they had for nodejs within the bank. Pizza with beer in the crust is a dream of his (he hasn't cracked the whole sogginess thing yet). Painpoint aka Sharepoint is the top joke so far.

They have a logentites section in their json request to allow clients report information to the server. Detailed section on NTML authentication. Using Flod to track the performance metrics of the requests.
