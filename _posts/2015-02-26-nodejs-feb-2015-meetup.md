So i thought this was an early april fools joke when i saw the two talks for this evening. A nodejs meetup dedicated to home craft beer brewing but the agenda is the agenda and i shit you not. I suspect these guys are going to put my little home brew setup to shame.

1st talk : [brewfactory.org](http://brewfactory.org/) The main take away i got from this talk was the use of [Isomorphic JavaScript](http://isomorphic.net/javascript) within the project. [@slashdotpeter](https://twitter.com/slashdotpeter) was happy to answer random brewing questions even if [Cianomaidin](https://twitter.com/Cianomaidin) wanted to know when the first node js [PÃ¡linka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka) brewing kit would be available! Check out his company site [risingstack.com](http://risingstack.com/).

2nd talk : [@juliancheal](http://twitter.com/juliancheal) kicks off a talk on [Cylon.js](http://cylonjs.com) which is robotics api written in node js. There may be issues with his website at [juliancheal.co.uk/](http://www.juliancheal.co.uk/). Julian had a bag full of devices which had various flashing lights which could be turned on and off via cylon. A nat demo showing how the code which runs on the devices can also be run in a browser. 

Internet of Things in the Pub
We are introduced to the [smart breathalyzer](http://www.alcohoot.com/) which is a mobile app plugin for measuring how many drinks you've had. You've identified your drunk so the next logical step is to call a drone what will deliver you another beer. Neat demo of a drone attempting to deliver a can of beer. I'll hold off until the drone cab pull a pint of guinness and deliver that before i'll sack all the bar men.

[Spark devices](https://www.spark.io/) are mentioned and its [cloud API](http://docs.spark.io/api/). The next demo involves a dance mat sending commands to the drone as our human dances to gangnan style, the drone let on it was too cool to dance.
