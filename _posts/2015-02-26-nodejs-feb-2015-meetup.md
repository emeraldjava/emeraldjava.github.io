So i thought this was an early april fools joke when i saw the two talks for this evening. A nodejs meetup dedicated to home craft beer brewing but the agenda is the agenda and i shit you not. I suspect these guys are going to put my little home brew setup to shame.

1st talk : [brewfactory.org](http://brewfactory.org/) The main take away i got from this talk was the use of [Isomorphic JavaScript](http://isomorphic.net/javascript) within the project. [@slashdotpeter](https://twitter.com/slashdotpeter) was happy to answer random brewing questions even if [Cianomaidin](https://twitter.com/Cianomaidin) wanted to know when the first node js [PÃ¡linka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1linka) brewing kit would be available!

2nd talk : [Cylon.js](http://cylonjs.com)
