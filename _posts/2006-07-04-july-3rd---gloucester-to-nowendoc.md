<TABLE BORDER="1"><TR><TD>Distance</TD><TD>Overall Total</TD></TR><br /><TR><TD>77 km</TD><TD>1401 km</TD></TR></TABLE><br /><br />The cycle book i'm using recommends traveling this stage in the opposite direction.<br />Warning one. As quoted from the book, "the 6.4 km winding very steep descent", warning two. So of course i'm doing it against the grain - so the enjoyable downhill stage turns into a 7 hour slog with over 2000m climbing. You know its steep then the trucks are coming downhill at about 5kmph, and there are runoff ramps about every 1km.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_1260.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_1260.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />Anyway - at the end of the day - it was all TOO EASY. The mountain was broken.<br /><br />Nowendoc has about 4 buildings, a general store, a motel and two others that seems to be used by horses. The dude running the general store is a belfast man who came out here in 1961, had a good chat with him about ship building and other random things.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/1600/IMG_1276.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/916/2956/320/IMG_1276.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
