<B>June 24th - Sydney 1</B><br /><br />Wake up about 7ish, with some auld dude snoring into my ear, an accidental<br />of movement woken him - punk. So we seem to be close to sydney, i think we<br />must be ahead of schedule. We hit the  sydney subarbs and the train like <br />slows to waking pace - completly ridiculose. The old dude has started snoring<br />again,, get me of this train..<br /><br />Eventually get into sydney main station. At last a proper city. Anyway, sort<br />of somewhere to stay. Ireland play the aussies tonight, so arrange to meet a<br />friend of my sisters. The irish mafia are everywhere. Watch the match in coogee,<br />the bar has this special on once the game that all scooner beers are free until<br />the first point is scored. We had a scare after 5 min when ireland looked liked<br />kicking a point, but our man o'gara went for the line. Someone scores after about<br />15 mins, and ther must be about 20 beers of the table in front of us. Needless to<br />say these where all drank, the result of the game was forgotten, and of course we<br />have to head back into the city for some dodgy irish pub.<br /><br /><B>June 25th - Sydney 2</B><br /><br />Think i got home about 4ish, with the biggest collection of aussie coins in <br />my pockets that anyone has ever gathered.<br /><br />I woke up about 4ish (pm). Small tour of the town, various promises of never<br />drinking again.
